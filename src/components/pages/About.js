                                I am a full-stack web developer currently residing in Los Angeles.
                                I am skilled at building web applications from the ground up â€“ from
                                concept, to design, to writing functional, testable, and efficient code
                                while focusing on responsive and elegant designs. I continue to learn new
                                technologies and techniques through freelancing and my own side projects
                                that I use to influence and improve my overall ability in web development.

                            <p>
                                My coding philosophy starts with strategic planning, designing, and
                                developing applications to help reach desired objectives and goals.
                                I surround myself with technical and creative people, activities, hobbies, and
                                endeavors that push me to keep learning through experience. My background
                                was originally in music and music technology. I have always loved playing
                                music ever since I was young and had dreams to take over the world. Now
                                my sights are set on impacting the world through technology by helping
                                businesses succeed and accomplish new goals.
